# Hockey League
is the simulation
team, responsible for creating the logic that will simulate hockey seasons for a fictional hockey
league (DHL, the Dalhousie Hockey League). It is a full command-line based simulator capable of
reproducing the successes and failures of a hockey team over decades of hockey seasons. It is capable of interesting things like simulating trading players, player injuries & retirements,
and game & league results. We will build this project using Agile methodology, meaning it will
evolve over three iterations.
